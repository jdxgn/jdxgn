### Hi there 👋 I'm [Jatan](https://github.com/jdxgn/)!

[![Linkedin Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/-LinkedIn-0e76a8?style=flat-square&logo=Linkedin&logoColor=white)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jatandewgun/)

I'm a Data Engineer, currently based out of Stockholm and working with Tink.com towards making a better future of finance!

TL;DR I build modern data pipelines and ensure they don't clog keeping in mind the architectural and infrastructural concerns.

I am an advocate of life long learning and curious about event driven architectures, distributed systems, DataOps and MLOps at scale.

Keeping industry standards and the business requirements in mind, I am skilled at delivering scalable and efficient data pipelines, data warehousing and management strategies and data intensive applications. I also enjoy demystifying puzzles around Data Infrastructure with my fellow engineers.

That being said, I love writing code. Ever since I wrote my first program, I have been obsessed with the idea of using code to simplify the most complex of issues. Programming for me started off as an interest and now has become a passion and is something that I practice actively through personal projects, contributions to open source projects (whenever I can), helping and mentoring others to learn how to code and of course, friendly programming face-offs with my friends.
